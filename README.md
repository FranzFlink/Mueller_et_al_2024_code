# High-resolution Arctic surface temperature and surface type retrieval with data from an airborne thermal imager 

This repository reproduces the analysis and retrievals outlined in _. The repo is divided in three major parts:
1. Surface type retrieval using state-of-the-art supvervised statistical learning; for the final version a random forest classifier is used, but many different models are evaluated
2. Radiative transfer simulations with libRadtran, simulating the cloud-free surface temperature at theflight level of the airplane
3. Comparing/Validating the results with different satellite products (Surface temp.: MODIS; Ice frac.: MODIS-AMSR2) and reanalysis products (ERA5 and CARRA)
